# PropertEase
A minimalistic web app to help users find their (fictional) dream home.

## Overview 
The motivation behind this project arised when I began looking for ways to familiarise myself with some common full-stack web 
development practices which which fairly new to me, and I figured there was no better way to apply what I had been learning than to get my hands 
dirty and tackle a project like the one presented in this repo.
Anyone wishing to try out the application can do so here https://propertease-engq.onrender.com/properties and any feedback is much appreciated.

## Usage 
I tried to keep the design as intuitive as possible, hence once you follow the link above you should see a navbar at the top with the following links :
- **PropertEase** will direct you to the home page, where all the property listings uploaded will be displayed. You can also filter listings by applying search filters through
  the form located on this page.
- By following the **More** link on each listing card you can view a property's images gallery and book a viewing from the available dates, assuming you are logged in and not the authour of the listed home.
- once you log-in or sign-up thorugh the navbar links, you will be able to reach your user dashboard by following the **Account** link.
- if you registered as a **standard user** you will find your liked properties and you booked viewings on your dashboard, otherwise if you are a **landlord** you will see all the properties you previously listed as well
  as reminders of all viewings users have booked on any of your properties.
- from your dashboard, you can logout or delete your account and cancel viewings. On top of that, landlords can also create a new listing, edit or delete previous ones as well.
